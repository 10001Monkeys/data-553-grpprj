1579	As the title of this review states, this is probably the very best note-taking application available to the digital world Ever since I started to use it it has been wonderful!

73	Rip off .. What comes basic in most quality editors, this app wants us to buy at up to  2 each totalling over  30.00!!!!?? what a rip off! It doesn't even have hue which I use more then any other filter. Highly dissatisfied! There are hundreds of editors in the play store plus most phones come with one that's fairly decent...  hit share to find yours.  Uninstalled.	2	-2

784	I actually believe this app is totally awesome in helping me prepare for my boards. However, just as the muscle name is given in audio; I wish there was an option hearing all the muscles info in audio. For me, retaining info comes better in audio, activities, and constant quizzing.	4	-1

798	I was shocked to find the app includes overhead clearances and one can filter that down to what they are worried about.  Looks to be very thorough.  I have not yet tried it on the road but I am amazed at what I can find by sitting her in my house.  I am a little concerned about how much functionality I will find in remote locations with no cell service.  Time will tell.  I may have to update my rating when that situation arises which will be in 4 weeks.  Happy camping everyone!	3	-4

763	I've bee using EveryTrail.com for years - loving its ease and look for uploading my rides and embedding the maps on my blog. I used the free app for a long time, until recently on a trip I needed to find a trail and download it to use offline. Enter EveryTrail Pro. This app has practically replaced my GPS unit. I adjust the GPS settings to extend battery life and I can go on epic rides and still have power to text my buddies photos from the trail. I highly recommend it for on the fly trail mapping needs. Worth every penny.	4	-1

570	This game is really fun and a great way to learn facts, geography, capitals, landmarks and locations of all of the great states in the United States! My nephews are into strategically placing the stacks. Super learning fun!	3	-1
918	This is a great app. I've used ODB on my iPod Touch and then my iPhone before I got an iPad 2. Each version is more refined. I like the way that the app remembers my choice of Bible version (currently 'The Message') when I tap on the Scripture for the day. This isn't the case with the iPhone app. One always has to change the version from the default.  There are a couple formatting issue suggestions:  1. The poem at the bottom of the page is almost never formatted like the online website. It would be nice if the lines were stacked and not simply strung out in a row. 2. One of the things I've always enjoyed are the cover photos. The cover for the current month shows in the upper righthand corner, but there is no way to enlarge it. One would think that a simple double-tap could bring up the cover art full screen? 3. When traveling I don't always have a wifi link, so having issues cached is nice. In those instances I simply use my Bible app (or print version) to get the Scripture for the day. I don't expect (or want) ODB to cache the Scripture from Biblegateway.com on my device, but it would be nice if there was a way in the app set-up to direct the ODB app to my Olivetree app onboard for the Scripture of the day. May be too difficult for what is already an elegant app.  Keep up the good work!	3	-2

1151	First of all, both Dragon Dictation and Dragon Search are amazing and I'm using the slow 3G. They're beyond amazing on my wife's iPhone 4! As a heavy user of Dragon Dictation, it would be very useful to be able to clear the screen and start new, perhaps by shaking the iPhone. Sometimes it's easier to start over rather than edit out one word.	3	-2

I also like having the prayers for the start and end my day.  I consider this to be a must-have app for all busy Catholics.	3	-1

32	Seriously needed permissions?? I think not!! Why in the world would I give anyone or application the right to make phone calls through my phone, edit my text messages and send them, take video and pictures?? This is sadly getting worse with each update and this is supposed to be a security program??? I was pleased at first with this app but have no respect for it or the idiots coming up with these updates. This needs to stop!!! Next you will need to access my credit report. Here's an idea, DELETED!!!!!!	3	-3

81	10 year old package that barely works. Total waste of  15! Doesn't display many word documents and excel files.  Editing with that is a torture. I bought it because it was the best for Palm and blackberry. Wasted  15.. OfficeSuite 7 is the that does the job done.	3	-4
82	I want my money back The one thing I hate about it always doesn't work it works when it wants to apps should be 99 cents instead of three dollars I don't think it's worth  3 I recommend you do not buy it unless you have money to waste!	1	-4
83	a a	1	-1
84	Good Good aps	2	-1
86	Costs too much and too many add ons Despite its many options, I've had experienced many issues with this product. It has crashed quite a few times already in the last two days, moreover why do I have to pay so much for 'add ons' that should be standard such as fonts and dictionary? This just shows the developer is being too greedy.  In addition it seems to be very slow on my nexus 10	1	-3
88	Abysmal controls and AI, repetitive campaign Fun game, abysmal controls and AI.  Why on earth team 17 opted for touch controls instead of virtual arrows or a d-pad, I have no idea. Now the AI: uses grenades or bazooka about 90 percent of the time with absolute perfection. Calculating wind speeds and never missing a single shot even if it is necessary to shoot in the complete opposite direction and rely solely on wind. Please make it more human and make it use the other weapons a lot more often. Plus the campaign is just skirmish,  no actual missions.	2	-2
89	Nice I like it	2	-1
92	Awkward menus I bought this app. ..quickly attempted to do my most common types of formatting, and found it very slowly and fiddly on my note 2.  Much better on the BlackBerry.  So, as quickly as I could, I attempt to un install and get a refund, can't!!! So am I stuck?	2	-2
94	AVG Tried and tried and tried to use the AVG find my phone part of this app. . Didn't find it once just kept saying try later.. so I did and kept on trying.. I paid for this app so I kind of expect it to work?? Not enough to the app either. . Dull to use.. looks Dull and had I not paid for it I would delete in a heart beat..	2	-2

103	Not horrible...but All in all, it's in the tradition of the franchise. In campaign mode it's pretty annoying that the AI never misses, and the wind is always exactly what it needs to hit.	4	-3
104	Ehhh Every level after 19 is ridiculously hard.  The enemy worms take hardly any damage and seem to aim perfectly through the tiniest spaces while your worms die by 1st or 2nd turn,  leaving you with 1 worm against 8 or 9... I'm ready to uninstall	2	-3
105	Specs fail I noticed the same on my note 2 it says tht i have dual-core...	1	-3
107	Grt Gud	1	-1
108	Android Very nice app	3	-1
109	Same old worms, terrible controls. The developer has opted for the classic tap either side of the screen to move and drag the reticle to aim touch control system, it does not support controller or keyboard input. The result is a control system that is borderline unresponsive and makes fine movement or fast movement completely inefficient. This game is so tedious to play, it certainly isn't worth the hefty price tag associated with it. If you bought this during the sale; you got a great deal, but as someone who paid full price to support Team 17, I'm disappointed in this lackluster port. Overall the game is a great example of what can happen to a great idea when it's executed poorly. I am however, happy to give Team 17 a few extra dollars, and hope they make improvements over time.	3	-4

133	"There was a time for this app The fact that the app needs me to register after I have paid for it sucks. The fact that it makes me do it with no way of turning it off other than hitting ""later"" every time it updates is a deal breaker. Get a 365 account and use Microsoft's full version of office."	1	-2

704	Updated to the latest version andnow all my Microsoft word documents won't open in the app, so I can't view anything  Also lost the ability to export into pages for editing  Hoping this is just a glitch that gets fixed fast, but really problematic for me since I use this almost exclusively for work  Please fix cause I love Dropbox!	3	-3

77	Galax s4 Can't search for friends online	2	-1
673	The main issue I have with this app is that there isn't a 'keep me logged in' feature Please add and I will reward you greatly (with 5 stars)  )	3	-1
295	Apparently I am not allowed to have my own values so this app has decided what I can and can't see. Unlike the rest if this country - I don't need anyone   to hold my hand and tell me what to do. Bring back the personals section you Idiots! I used to love this app for business and a good laugh, now I don't think I will use it much at all. Very disappointed with this update!!!!	3	-3
763	The app used to work great, but now it keeps freezing and I can't get into my  notes It is very frustrating I have to delete the app and download it again What a pain!!	3	-5

318	On top of the other annoyances listed below, where is the support for Dropbox? The app looks pretty, but lacks a lot of the organizational support I use daily. Either iCloud needs folder support, or pages/numbers/keynote need Dropbox support!	3	-3
1031	Love the information and to read the reviews Very helpful in deciding where I want to go and stay	3	-1
910	I love the do-anything note capabilities text, inline photos, audio files, web-clips (which I have yet to become proficient with, but will)!    The cross-platform access to your notes on the cloud is brilliant and a HUGE time saver!    This app, combined with the inexpensive bluetooth keyboard that I bought recently have given me a power mobile information gathering and organizing capability	3	-2
15	Buggy app broke by update Another paid app fail.  Edit: back to 1 star again! Now crashes everytime a battles won.	1	-3
571	Since they did a new update almost all my JPEG take too much time to open or even don't open I need to save the file to see the photo on my iPhone   How can I have the old version?????	2	-1

1062	It is impossible to refine a hotel search for specific criteria beyond location, price and quality Those are well done and quality reviews and coverage are the reasons we use TA Especially during peak seasonal flows, many of us travel with pets We have a terrible time finding clean, reliable hotels Most sites for pet travel are woefully inadequate How hard would it be to include this as an additional search filter? That would bring in helpful reviews that would not only enhance the site experience but also improve the field	2	-4
1192	Best pic edit app Great app Jus cant find how to remove text from a pic	3	-1
314	I tried myfitnesspal, live strong, and this app at the same time.  This cost the most money and I figured it had great reviews.  It has an extremely small database.  If your Asian or like Asian food pass on this app.  It didn't have braised tofu or general tso's chicken in the database.  And I doubt the waiter could tell me my caloric intake either.  I deleted it and am currently using myfitnesspal (free) & livestrong (.99) and they work great.	3	-2

500	Looks like it would be a great app, but it only downloads grades for 1 class...hmmm. Pretty useless for me right now.  I'm extremely disappointed since the website is difficult to use on my iPhone. This app has too many connection problems & it's too slow. I'll use the crappy designed website until this app gives me something useful to see. I'll try back later :(	3	-4
892	This has become my main notes program  Wish I could do handwriting on it  Love how can I can put outlook emails in it   Using more than my other note apps in the iPad	3	-1
903	Great app for David Allen's 'Getting Things Done' organizational techniques Syncs with iPhone, iPad and Mac immediately so you always have access to what you need wherever you are    I use this app to keep track of everything from work tasks, household chores, shopping lists and ideas for the future without getting them mixed up  Check out TheSecretWeaponorg for ideas on how to set up your Evernote to stay organized     Great app!!!!	3	-3
1141	What the heck? Love the program BUT since you added the 'share this pin'  option I have been receiving spam that my friends did not send  My account was hacked too How about a fix???	3	-2
810	Was just beginning to trust this app until 7 update Quit working for all practical purposes Will watch for patches and post an updated review I really was wanting this app to be effective They have some silly new process to sell post it notes Not!	2	-2
538	Since the update, it won't backup to Dropbox	1	-1
803	Awful Like other users have reported, when you open the app it freezes and you have to double-click home to kill it off Useless If you can get it to run (there are tricks) then you have to deal with the ridiculous interface - like scrolling to the bottom to see a square list that has a couple of notebooks listed, not all And then a few more taps to get to your notes It's a lot of clicking to do something as simple as review your notes There are so many other design metaphors available, it's crazy why they went this way Anyhow, I miss Catch and some others This app as is I would say is near a waste of time	2	-4
451	Apps fool u	1	-2
884	How dirty! Who are you to say that I need to change my password! Especially since I was already creating a l-o-n-g note Interrupted my work flow and then lost my note after changing my password!!!!!!!!!!!!!  and you call this 'EVERnote' ? Should be 'NEvER NOTE'!  I'd laugh but I am too busy cursing!  Waste of an entire morning switching to another note taking app then deleting this app once I have time to transfer remaining notes to 'ELSEWHERE' note app!!!!	2	-2
475	"Got my blood test results 2 days after my blood was drawn from my doc. 7 days later this app still says my results are ""in progress"". Not at all a food app for getting something so medically important. Always trust a phone call to an app .... They need to upload the results quicker or not have an app! Sucky !!"	2	-3
966	I started using trip advisor when my husband got a traveling job and I occasionally would go with him  Since then we have been addicted and I've hooked my parents on it too  Great for finding local gems in restaurants and decent hotels I love seeing the trip advisor signs when I go into restaurants now  Everyone can be a critic	3	-2

1002	The TripAdvisor App is a shorter and better way to look up something instead of going onto their website and wasting more time! Sometimes, you can't always find what you are looking for so you have to go on the website but, it's the majority I do all of my bookings with TripAdvisor through the app or through the Internet and it still works very well! Great job!!!	3	-1

1191	Locked out I had to reinstall the app because I got a replacement phone I never thought I would use the community sharing and whatnot, so I didn't bother to remember my sign ins Forgot info link will not send anything to my email so I lost everything I did and no way to contact devs	1	-2
1198	Good as an editor,but a little slow Yeah! It is good but a li'l bit slow	2	-1
1006	Great app but I wish it could sort andor rate based on which meal you would like for restaurants I would like to find a great breakfast place but can't tell which is the best breakfast place	3	-1
305	I think this is a fun app to play with, but after playing it for a few days, I have noticed it has the same story every time. First, you go to college or just get a career. Then you graduate/get career an then you have random things happen to you - vacation, a raise, etc. Then you get married, have kids, continue your career or get a new one, then you go live the rest of your life in your home.   Overall, it is a very enjoyable game, but , like many apps, you can get sock of it overtime.	4	-1
154	Force closes all the time This app isn't worth the money. It crashes more than any of my other camera apps & makes me restart my phone before I can reopen the app.	1	-2
1138	Love itmaybe too much App is easy to use and navigate I use it to look for everything from recipes to gifts to random humor I may need a pinterest intervention soon!	3	-1
184	Not good Why i cannot clear chat history. Come on.  There is no option for clear history. Please fix that!	2	-2
721	Thanks, Dropbox  Here I was, thinking Dropbox is one of the greatest inventions since sliced bread  One update, and I can't access my files or photos on my gen 3 IPad  I know it is Presidents' Day weekend, but can someone fix this please?  Maybe you are enjoying time with familysure would be nice to share pics with them	3	-1

1090	I like it It is that best way to chat every  one	2	-1
353	I'm glad I didn't pay the  10 for this app. Every time I try to load it it crashes. There's a 50-50 chance that I will get alerts. I got the app so i would know about warnings and to help keep my family safe. I would not recommend this app unless they fix all these issues. I want something that will work all the time not half the time.	2	-1
31	Forces u to upgrade 1 star only, cuz it forces u to upgrade ever now and then. I'm thinking of deleting it .. probably once I finish writing this review.	1	-1
1017	Love being able to look up the specific areas I'm visiting and have LOCALS chiming in too!!	3	-1
1066	So easy to use!	1	-1
858	As a writerdaydreamer, I'm constantly in my head thinking up new ideas, and having a tool that allows me to access my material pretty much anywhere is fantastic Instead of just jotting down a note (which I can't always do) and referring to it later on once I've gotten home, logged onto a computer, &amp opened up a Word document, it's so much easier and convenient to do it on this app I've even used Evernote for school stuff, essays mostly, so there's no need for emailing documents to myself There are only a few errorsglitches that I've encountered but nothing that makes me want to stop using this app I love it too much!!	3	-2
191	All my apps are intrusive?? What happened? I have had my apps since then. But all of a sudden, antivitus is telling that 101 threats was found? (All apps)?? Howcome?! All my apps are downloaded from playstore. There should be threat even before if all my apps are really intrusive!	2	-3
14	It sucks When I press ? nothing happens plus I can't even share the videos I make	1	-2
984	I always read all the reviews while we are traveling on the road My husband and I crisscross the country every summer and I am the navigator I find most reviewers to be honest if you read all of them or at least half, you can get a pretty good opinion Many times I didn't pay attention to a negative review because I thought they had some sort of personal problem and was sorry afterwards Trip advisor is a good opinion to take into account when you are traveling in a new place and have no idea where to go	3	-2
700	Can't install the update	1	-1
404	The only thing this is good for is starting documents. If you try to upload your documents from google documents the document is just gray.	2	-1
261	Good Its good but can u get me a layout of 11 pictutes coz we have a grup of 11 members and we need to use it as the icon can u add the same as soon as possible	2	-1
1206	Best app Can always edit my pics and they will end up well	2	-1
843	This is a very useful and helpful app In my opinion, the only thing it's missing is video handling You can add pictures and audio to your notes, and I think you should be able to add videos, too	3	-1
1076	Very helpful great to have it but why some review they are not publish in here, I wrote negative regarding, Best Westen hotel in Myrtle Beach, they dont want to publish I hope this is not like BBB agency, paying money for get good review things	4	-2
633	I'm having issues with moving my files	1	-1
823	I have over 200 notes in Evernote (verified in the Mac version and on Evernotecom), but only 4 of them appeared in the new version of this app until I deleted and reinstalled it Logging out and logging back in didn't work The new UI will take some getting used to but feels cleaner and faster than before	1	-1
796	This version still has a marketplace  full of ads I can't hide, and the image attachment only shows me pics from September and earlier So it's pretty useless  Quit trying to sell me stuff and fix your bugs!!!!!	3	-3
825	No notes showing up All the notebooks are there but they are all empty Boo	1	-1
463	Requires access to grades and it'll get 5 strs in my book	1	-1

1039	Great for on the road reviews and info while traveling, love to use while out of town or at the house to get info on places to eat, go check out, or if you're planning a trip	3	-1
477	I was using the app which seemed great until I noticed it was posting to my fb page even though I opted out. Deleted app because it doesn't give you the option again after the fact	3	-1
65	Unusable Unusable. Whem trying to find the right forum it takes forever to scroll down!	1	-1
915	Used to think it was acceptable at least, but after losing my notes a few days ago I cant give this app a good rating Dont waste your time on it	2	-3
1190	Great app Best picture editor	3	-1
226	Urrrrm After my third re installing, it finally has scenery. Before hand, it was just black shapes everywhere. I could not even see the walls. This killed my internet as it is a very big game that takes half an hour to install - if you don't like the game, their is no chance of a refund. Once I finally got the proper game, it is very pretty with smooth graphics, an amazing sound track, and some of the best scenery I've ever seen on my tablet. In the next update, I want to be seeing the right installment first time, a chance of a refund, and free roam! Free roam was the best part of the old games, I would love to have it on my tablet! Thank you ?	4	-4
1044	We use the recommendations regularly to find restaurants during our travels We are rarely disappointed Need I say more?	1	-2
946	This is a great app for planning a trip If wanting to go somewhere definitely use this!! It is helped me find restaurants in cities I've never been and great deals on flights and hotels Totally worth it to download	3	-1
355	The new update doesn't work. Won't even open now. Can't believe I paid for this app!! I have found better apps for free!!!	2	-1
20	"NEEDS TO BE UPDATED. Was Fun & Challenging. Desperately in need of an update. Paid for the Allie levels SEPTEMBER 1 and still no new levels- when is ""soon""?? No new levels of the week. No updates. Used to be a favorite..."	2	-3

556	This used to be my favorite app, but now that I can no longer open Excel files it's useless to me	3	-3
729	Seriously needs a way to sort so folders are on top like normal	2	-1
674	It allows me to share individual photos but not entire folders!  What good is that?? I can easily text someone a single photo  WTH ?  I want to be able to send a link to people of an entire folder with many pics in it from my mobile  Seems useless now   On the other hand I do like that I can view and share excel documents That's pretty cool Although it does take quite a while to load it seems	3	-3
1037	The reason I really like this app is that real people like me actually use the app and write the review Hard to blow smoke with so many of us using it now	3	-1
220	Cannot get my code! I can't get my code even I send my phone number already. Please fix it!	2	-1
228	Doesn't save progress online Great game except it doesn't save my progress in online mode. I'm smashing fools and still stuck on Rank 11.	3	-2
156	Battery hog! When I view what app uses the most battery...it's AVG!  I'm sure it does its job well, but I would like to use my battery for other apps please...	2	-1

611	Music takes 15 seconds to load after you have selected a song ( doesn't matter if I'm on Verizon LTE or Wifi) also, it doesn't play the next song automatically instead you have to open the app, go back and pick the next song in the folder You can't even hit the 'next' button to skip tracks  Please fix these in the next update!  Running iOS7 Same issues on iOS 6	2	-1

166	Way too slow to launch This app takes two to three seconds longer to launch than the stock camera app.	1	-1
520	Won't let me even try out the filters or take photos without enabling Location Service. Basically, Facebook wants to track my location and plaster it all over their site.   Even worse, they lie about it being required in order for the iPhone to allow the app to access photos I've already taken. Really? That's interesting, because I have location services blocked for Instagram and other photo apps and they work just fine. Funny how that works.   By the way, the filters are terrible as well. Not nearly as good as Instagram, Camera  and others. Save yourself some time and don't even bother.	2	-4
419	Eeyup	1	-1
401	I used to love this app, but since the update it's gone downhill. I can't sync to my Kindle Fire or get to the store.	3	-1

41	Not working. I have a wifi printer and when I try to print from my droid RAZR Max HD it says need to download update.. then when I try to download update, it says Update cannont be completed. Error. Fix and I'll change my rating. Or advise me what to do.	1	-2
774	Agree with recent reviewers - this update completely ruined this excellent app for the iPhone on IOS7 Doesn?t work AT ALL Opens, then freezes completely and can?t even open any of my notes or create new ones  Doesn?t anyone test these apps before releasing them??  Please fix ASAP!!	4	-3
252	it is very important to add a landscape sheet orientation and Word Art (basic options at least)	1	-1
870	I have been a long-time user of google docsdrive and finally switched to Evernote for its vastly greater functionality just as I was beginning to enjoy and appreciate the app, taking notes on a book I'm reading both textually and by taking pictures of passages, I accidentally touched the 'plain text' format button this move is apparently irreversible and I can no longer see the photos I took of passages from the book I have read, which I was planning to quotecite later I did not foresee such a drastic loss as possible, so I do not have these notes archived elsewhere if I am to use an app that allows for this much thought and effort to be stored within it, I need to be able to trust that my work will not be lost with a simple touch screen selection error This app has some very useful and convenient features, but I cannot continue to use it after such a loss frustrating and disappointing	3	-3
266	Aside from the occasional glitch, pretty good Awesome graphics, nice sound, just don't expect AC3 or 4 scale naval warfare. The battles are not what I'd call real time, more a cross between real and turn based. Randomly sailing about is also quite pointless due to being able to fast travel almost anywhere. The main missions and races are fun however as they are much less repetitive than battling. There have been a few bugs but the developer seems to be squashing them quite often.	3	-3
1152	Love it I love, love, love being able to pin things on the run I love being able to access those pins on the run!  If only I could text a pin or the link to friends that aren't pinners yet	4	-1

487	"The app is fine but the one thing, (and really only thing you need it for) isn't working. I attempted to pay a bill using the credit card already on file and  after several minutes of ""beach ball"" froze the app. I had to go to the website to pay my bill."	3	-1
1189	Picsart Awesome photo editor	3	-1
630	Its amazing The only thing to make it better is to have the ability or export videos to your camara roll	3	-1

829	The more I use Evernote, the more ways I find to use it Love the excellent and consistent multi-platform experience and sync	4	-1
119	Doesn't start up The app gets to the loading screen and then force closes, please fix. Running Android 4.4.2 kit kat on a nexus 7 2013. I'm assuming it force closes as I'm using ART runtime. Please update to work with ART! :-)	2	-2
450	Loading of content is very slow and non-automated.  Does not load reliably even when iPad is plugged in in wifi. Thus it's cumbersome to keep the issues current. Once loaded the reading experience is very good.  Significantly better than print.   Howeve instead of just picking up my iPad and reading each morning I have to wait for the download.	3	-2
791	Can't use on 4s with iOS 7 Freezes upon opening and can't use the app at all Plus the new app is super confusing and difficult to use when it works on iPad A massive step in the wrong direction	3	-2
961	This is an overall great update and had made more quickness and also just a smoother running app , tripadvisor itself is the best app to find a restaurant or hotel that suits your needs , love the consistent users and current up to date reviews only draw is the distance filter is no longer there so it sets 50 mi radius bit far when u want to go 20 or less but besides that amazing!!	4	-1
90	Discrasefull They make us uninstall just to charge us 1.99 when you can download or free I would of never used it again but my online job is through teamspeak and I'm always on the move ducking bankers honestly	1	-2
664	Cannot download latest update, it was working fine for a year and then the updates started I felt I needed to give this two stars because its been four days and they haven't fixed it yet I use this app for work and now I can't	3	-1

368	It needs redstone and online world mupltiplayer accessibility Cus I'm already bored of the update!	1	-2
1070	I've discovered that a lot of phone apps don't compare to the full website in terms of functionality That is not the case with Trip Advisor- it works just like the website	1	-1
934	This new layout is awesome Use this app daily and love it	3	-1
273	Nice Nice app, I enjoy it but my kids have more fun. I wish they had more manly stuff. Until then I give it 4 stars	3	-1
930	 50 bucks a year to use this? iCloud is FREE Why do we have to pay so much money to get access?  Is there a rule in our iTunes account that we have to like whatever junk they tell us to like?	2	-2
540	I never know when it's gonna even work I click on the icon, my enter password shows up and either it's stuck on that and I can't even enter a password, or I enter it and nothing happens This was a great app Now it stinks! Big time!	3	-3
782	Seriously ready to stop paying for this monthly It will now only work if I uninstall it then re-install it It will only work once and then if I open it again it will be nothing but a black screen Then I have to delete it and install it again for it to work only once It was perfect before the last update If it's not broken then don't fix it	2	-1
1183	It's too user friendly Using Picsart is fun!!	3	-1
170	Native crash when selecting the new ship Update: they fixed the 0 of 0 issue, but app got native crash when selecting the new ship... Pros: nice graphics, beautiful ocean simulation. Cons: no immersive mode for 4.4 devices, the game is a bit short and game mode/event is too simple, the battle gets a bit boring after a few hours.	3	-2
128	It's so slow and it turns off right in the middle	1	-1
846	I love Evernote and feel so organized now I like being able to take pictures and use it often for business cards I have recommended to friends I can't live without my Evernote	3	-1
55	Can I go back to older version? Loved the app, was quick and always connected until the last update.  Have tried every suggestion.  When I first open it, nothing happens, it just sits at an empty screen.  Have to close and reopen several times and it is so slow to connect now.  Hope it improves.  To be fair, I am having same is with lastest tappatalk upgrade also.  Galaxy Note	4	-1
207	Where dat mini games at? There should be mini games like in the iphone/ipod version	2	-1
781	Im on an original iPad mini and so maybe that's part of he deal but it seems like there are still little thins that need some work For example the spell check doesn't work just right and the search is slow at times Neither of these or any others will keep from giving this app a great rating   I also think that here are improvements I hope to see in the future One is full screen mode Maybe I'm missing this but the only time you get full screen is when you start a new note I'd like this options when reading or editing too   Keep up the good work!	3	-1

234	Working fine on wlan but distortion on mobile internet	3	-2
854	Impressed by its versatility in terms of the type of note one can take It's great to have the ability to input URL, photos, audio, and text And great that it has desktop integration for a computer  The drawback that I've encountered is though it offers labels it doesn't offer folders Editing and the dashboard in the app could use an easier interface Still good app though	3	-1
110	Never works right. Every update still never works right. Losses internet connection a lot. Lousy app.	1	-3

694	Even Google Drive can refresh folders   Some simple suggestions to increase usability  1 Currently, you have to leave the folder and come back in if you wish to refresh that folder Let me refresh my folder with a refresh button so that I can view changes to files in a more streamlined manner If I am constantly compiling a document on my computer and using my iPad to check that it looks okay or if I am constantly editing a photo and want a high quality, true color representation, then#REFRESH! 2 Refresh Button 3 Button that Refreshes the Current Folder's contents 4 The air smells a bit Why don't we REFRESH it? 5 It is stupidly simple to add a refresh button 6 Mentos The Refresh Button Maker 7 There's space on the top left of the app header to add a refresh button  Nothing is there at the moment It's lonely 8 Give me an R, Give me an E, Give me an F, Give me an R, Give me an E, Give me an S, Give me an H! What does that spell? Easily implementable refresh button with high utility even to people who don't know they need it yet! Yaaay!	3	-2

799	I have a premium account and I use Evernote for business and personal items all day long and I am very frustrated about the new advertisement section I've been graced with despite paying not to have advertisements  Also, there is no logic behind the new tag section I really like the the tag section, but I want to organize what pops up there I can't find a master list of reminders in the app or the desktop version Maybe I haven't looked hard enough, but this seems to be a gaping oversight  A calandra would be nifty as well	3	-4

812	There are some very real bugs in the updated Evernote! 1) It's very crash-prone, even after reinstalling and restarting the device (iPad, iPhone 5, iOS 7) 2) When scrolling, if you're not careful, whatever file you're touching while scrolling tends to open accidentally I want to like Evernote It has potential But after this long, if they still can't figure it out, they're hopeless A note app shouldn't be this cumbersome	2	-4

749	The fact that you can search within folders is extremely useful, and makes accessing files on the go far more convenient I also think the latest style refresh is a big positive in the right direction I use dropbox on all of my devices I would like to see sorting within the app improved (eg by date), but it's good otherwise	4	-1

88	Very Angry I bought this app to try to run a powerpoint.  Within one minute I knew it did not work and there was NO refund button for me to press.   15 is a lot of money for me and I bought the app with the understanding that I could try it for 15 minutes.  Here's my update - the app has not been refunded yet.   I tried again to use it and it crashes when accessing Google drive.   It also crashes half the time opening my power point and has no editing features when it does open.   This app would be terrible were it free.   For a high price it's ridiculous	1	-5

175	Unstable When typing messages it often locks up/slows down my phone. When I sign out it signs right back in, I have to force close it. Often dont get notifications and get messages late (sometimes not at all).  Also, I wish there was an option to turn off the call button. It is annoying to accidentally hit the call button.	1	-3

319	The one good thing about the last update ws the ability to make folders. But, you are not able to make folders inside folders. I wish you could. The bad things about the last update? Now typing has lag which is very annoying. I don't see how that happened since there is no crazy graphical interface or anything animated. The major thing that is pretty much a deal breaker for most people is the removal of the TAB button. I always hated that the TAB button was up on the ruler. I would prefer having only one shift key and place the TAB on the keyboard. But now i wish it was back up top at least. Now you have to go through a complicated process and menu to use it. I've stopped using Pages now since it is such a pain to tab unless you are using a bluetooth keyboard.	3	-4

570	The inverted colors of the icon induce retinal after images, and in-app, the whiteout is hard on the eyes The experience on an iPad Air is one of huge expanses of white or badly contrasting off-whitelight blue and stencil-thin pale icons battling the brightness of it all The spartan look works fine on an iPhone, where there is proportionately less white assaulting the eye with the iPad, however, I keep trying to reduce the brightness of the display, but that only further impacts contrast and legibility   Also why is it not possible to change names of files or folders??	3	-3

126	Missing a very basic feature This is a great camera app that's useless to me because they've neglected a basic function. First the pros: the interface is intuitive and easy to use, the self-timer is fully adjustable (rather than just having a 2 and 10 second option for example), and the editing options are also easy to use. However, I will not be using the app because of the lack of manual cropping. The crop menu gives several size options, you choose one, and the app....automatically crops your picture. Do you see where this is going wrong? I suppose if your pictures were always perfectly centered and you just wanted to get the correct dimensions, this would work. Me, I don't always have my perfectly composed shot. I use my phone to take many pictures of my (moving) children, and often I have a lot of space on one side that needs to be cropped out to make a good shot. A camera app that automatically crops in the center and doesn't give me the option to at least adjust the cropping is absolutely useless to me, and a complete waste of the money I paid for it. I looked all over for this feature, thinking they can't POSSIBLY have neglected such a basic function, but it is glaringly missing.	3	-4

135	Popularity from Herd Behavior Millions of users can be wrong. This app and application has a poor interface,  allows all sorts of strangers to harass you,  is not intuitive.

Part of the herd....  :(	2	-4

138	Loved it until... The most recent update has left me less than pleased. Double posting pics, messing up the way cover photos look, it's NOT better in fact it's worse. I use to give it 4 stars now it barely gets 2. Please fix before I lose more fans.	4	-3

140	Functionality is as advertised, but still buggy I use DSLR controller via wifi on a 6D. During operation varying function such as aperture control, white balance, etc would cease to react irreproducably. Timed bulb exposure (being the only advantage over Canon's own app and the reason why I bought the app) causes the app and the camera (!) to crash. Disappointing and expensive. I keep hoping for more reliable updates.	2	-2
